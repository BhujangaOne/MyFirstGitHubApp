My First Git Hub App

// My coding journey started when I was about 12 years old. I was already using Windows alot and already was able to reinstall the whole system, because I would break it accidentaly from time to time *haha*
// My father then took me to a computer course. The instructor of the course was a real geek and very nice. He borrowed me a book about QBasic programming. So I started to teach myself QBasic out of that book and was hooked. I kept on learning languages (HTML, PHP, MySQL, C++, JavaScript) and later had a break from dev.
// During the lockdown days of March 2020 my interest in dev came back and I started to familiarize myself with Unity and C#. A couple of small projects later I decided to try to become a Blockchain Dev. So here I am. My first week in. Will try to get the DSR React Demo from Amando Brands going.
// Keep up the vibes folks! DeFi gonna be big *haha*
